# Calculator Using Tkinter
# Calculator Using Tkinter | Python Tkinter GUI

A simple calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library. This graphical user interface (GUI) calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- **Clear Function**: Provides an option to clear the input and reset the calculator.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid input and displays error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the calculator logic.
- **Tkinter**: Python’s standard GUI library, used to create the calculator’s interface.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Tkinter is part of the standard Python distribution, but if it's missing, you can install it by running:
  
  ```bash
  pip install tk
Running the Application
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-tkinter.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd calculator-tkinter
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The calculator window will open, and you can start performing calculations.

Code Overview
app.py: This is the main Python script that creates the calculator's GUI and handles user interactions.
Functions:
press(num): Updates the current expression with the number or operator pressed.
equalpress(): Evaluates the expression and displays the result.
